# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I get past `Collecting notes…`?

Be patient while the cache builds. The more notes you have and the larger they are, the longer it takes. The cache continues to build if you close Alfred’s window, so check back later.

### Can I get a link to a note?

Unfortunately, there’s no method to do so programatically via the AppleScript API. It should be possible with GUI automation or parsing the Notes database, but those solutions are unofficial and prone to break when Apple makes a change.

### How do I report an issue?

Accurate and thorough information is crucial for a proper diagnosis. **At a minimum, your report should include:**

* The [debugger](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/debugger/) output of the failing action.
* Your installed versions of: the Workflow, Alfred, and macOS. *Be precise, don’t say “latest”.*
